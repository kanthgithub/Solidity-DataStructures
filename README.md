DataStructures and Storage Patterns in Solidity

## Serialization and Deserialization:

- https://github.com/kanthgithub/Seriality

  - Seriality is a library for serializing and de-serializing all the Solidity types in a very efficient way which mostly written in solidity-assembly.

- https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11246/convert-struct-to-bytes-in-solidity

  - Is there any convenient way to convert (e.g. cast) a struct type to bytes?

   - You can do something like this. Note, for every custom struct you'll have to write custom serialization and deserialization methods.

    ```js
    pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

    contract StructSerialization
    {
        function StructSerialization()
        {
        }

        event exactUserStructEvent(uint32 id, string name);

        //Use only fixed size simple (uint,int) types!
        struct ExactUserStruct
        {
            uint32 id;
            string name;
        }

        function showStruct(ExactUserStruct u) private
        {
            exactUserStructEvent(u.id, u.name);
        }


        function exactUserStructToBytes(ExactUserStruct u) private
        returns (bytes data)
        {
            // _size = "sizeof" u.id + "sizeof" u.name
            uint _size = 4 + bytes(u.name).length;
            bytes memory _data = new bytes(_size);

            uint counter=0;
            for (uint i=0;i<4;i++)
            {
                _data[counter]=byte(u.id>>(8*i)&uint32(255));
                counter++;
            }

            for (i=0;i<bytes(u.name).length;i++)
            {
                _data[counter]=bytes(u.name)[i];
                counter++;
            }

            return (_data);
        }


        function exactUserStructFromBytes(bytes data) private
        returns (ExactUserStruct u)
        {
            for (uint i=0;i<4;i++)
            {
                uint32 temp = uint32(data[i]);
                temp<<=8*i;
                u.id^=temp;
            }

            bytes memory str = new bytes(data.length-4);

            for (i=0;i<data.length-4;i++)
            {
                str[i]=data[i+4];
            }

            u.name=string(str);
         }

        function test()
        {
            //Create and  show struct
            ExactUserStruct memory struct_1=ExactUserStruct(1234567,"abcdef");
            showStruct(struct_1);

            //Serializing struct
            bytes memory serialized_struct_1 = exactUserStructToBytes(struct_1);

            //Deserializing struct
            ExactUserStruct memory struct_2 = exactUserStructFromBytes(serialized_struct_1);

            //Show deserealized struct
            showStruct(struct_2);
        }
    }
    ```

### Structs:

- Solidity tutorial: returning structs from public functions

  - https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-tutorial-returning-structs-from-public-functions-e78e48efb378
  
   - Return Struct and Array of Structs in solidity

   - https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/frequently-asked-questions.html#can-a-contract-function-return-a-struct
   
   ```
   Yes, but only in internal function calls.
   ```
   
 - Share Structs across contracts
 
   - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27259/how-can-you-share-a-struct-definition-between-contracts-in-separate-files
   
   You can with a library! Here's an example:

```js
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

library SharedStructs {
    struct Thing {
        address[] people;
    }    
}

contract A {
    SharedStructs.Thing thing;
}

contract B {
    SharedStructs.Thing thing;
}
```

- Two important things to keep in mind: 
   1) the library gets deployed to the chain and then is referenced by its address
   2) the library acts as a true pass-through, meaning msg.sender (and related values) refer to the original caller.
   
If you do not want to use libraries you can create an abstract contract that only contains the structs an inherit from them. It is kinda ugly if the contracts are not quite related.

```js
contract GeometryShapesData {
    struct Point {
        uint x;
        uint y;
    }
}

contract A is GeometryShapesData {
    mapping (bytes32 => Point) public points;
    function addPoint(bytes32 idx, uint x, uint y) public { 
        points[idx] = Point(x, y);
    }
    function getPoint(bytes32 idx) constant public returns (uint x, uint y) {
        return (points[idx].x, points[idx].y);
    }
}

contract B is GeometryShapesData {
    Point[4] public vertexes;
    function addVertex(uint pos, uint x, uint y) public { 
        vertexes[pos] = Point(x, y);
    }
    function getVertex(uint pos) constant public returns (uint x, uint y) {
        return (vertexes[pos].x, vertexes[pos].y);
    }   
```
